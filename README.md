## Welcome! 👋  

I am a Master's student at **KIT, Germany**, currently working on my **Master's Thesis on Fluid-Structure Simulations with Lattice Boltzmann Methods**. My research focuses on numerical simulations and high-performance computing.

### 🌱 What I'm Working On
- Contributing to **[OpenLB](https://www.openlb.net/)** – an open-source Lattice Boltzmann framework.
- Exploring **fluid-structure interactions** using LBM.
- Implementing efficient, scalable simulations.

### 🛠️ Tech & Skills
- **Languages:** R, Python, C++
- **Interests:** Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), HPC, Scientific Computing
